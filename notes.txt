pvc-namespace argument is not clear, what is this actually referring

The logs are not clear about what pods are not ready? Is it on
the source? Target?

# k logs rsync-wrpvs -c rsync
2021/08/26 01:41:21 [102] rsync: server sent "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request" rather than greeting
2021/08/26 01:41:21 [102] rsync error: error starting client-server protocol (code 5) at main.c(1657) [sender=3.1.3]
rsync: server sent "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request" rather than greeting
